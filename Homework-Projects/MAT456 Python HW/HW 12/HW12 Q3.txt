The plot looks close to correct but it could use some adjustments.  I spend a lot of time rotating my background NYC map to try and get the most accurate fit, but as you can see the Statue of Liberty is slightly off.  If I was able to rotate all of the points slightly counter clockwise and move them south a tiny bit, I think the points would be close to spot on.}
